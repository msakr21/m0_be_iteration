# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?

**Answer: I will need to brush up some more on this since I did this last with little to no brain power!**

- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?

**Answer: This wasn't the most difficult so far =/ it took like 10 minutes total.... The conditionals content felt meatier and I did explore some iterative concepts while trying to figure out the medium challenge!**

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?

**Answer: Syntax and practicing including it in my thinking approach**

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?

**Answer: none with regards to this particular lesson.**
